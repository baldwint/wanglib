class velocity6300(object):
    r"""
    A New Focus Velocity 6300 diode laser controller.

    To instantiate, pass an instrument object to the constructor.
    e.g., for a controller with GPIB address 1, attached to a
    prologix GPIB controller:

    >>> laser = velocity6300(plx.instrument(1, auto=False))

    where ``plx`` is the prologix object. If you're using prologix,
    it's very important to turn off read-after-write!

    To use with RS232, use ``\r`` as the termination
    character. For example:

    >>> from wanglib.util import Serial
    >>> laser = velocity6300(Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', baudrate=19200, term_chars='\r'))

    """

    # the 6300 has a non-standard GPIB implementation.
    # rather than render a response to each command sequentially
    # to the buffer and leaving it there until you read it,
    # this unit will respond to any read request
    # with the response to the most recent command - as many times
    # as you ask for it. This causes problems with prologix
    # GPIB controllers because it never appears to be done responding.
    # to avoid this, *always* turn off read-after-write using prologix.

    # furthermore, this controller responds to non-query commands
    # with the string 'OK'. We don't need to flush this out, though,
    # since that will be overwritten as soon as we issue a query.

    # use this behavior to make sensible error messages:
